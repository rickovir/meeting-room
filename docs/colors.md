*   **Hex Code (Approximate):** `#283593`

It is often used in charts, secondary icons, or as part of a gradient to add depth to the design.

#### **3. Background Colors**

The website cleverly uses two background colors to suit different content, which is a mark of professional design.

*   **A. Dark Theme Background:**
    *   **Color:** **Deep Charcoal Purple / Dark Night Background**
    *   **Hex Code (Approximate):** `#0A0A0F` (A near-black with a subtle purple tint).

*   **B. Light Theme Background:**
    *   **Color:** **Pure White / Very Light Gray**
    *   **Hex Code (Approximate):** `#FFFFFF` (main background) and `#F5F5F5` (for cards or sectioned areas).
    *   **Role:** Used for pages with a lot of reading material, like Case Studies and Blogs. The white background ensures optimal **readability and clarity**, giving a feeling of being **clean, professional, and open**.

#### **4. Text Colors**

Text color automatically adjusts based on the background to ensure legibility.

*   **On Dark Backgrounds:**
    *   **Primary Text:** **Bright White** (`#FFFFFF`)

*   **Colors:** **Data Visualization Hues** (e.g., blues, greens, yellows, oranges).
*   **Hex Codes (Approximate):** `#2196F3`, `#4CAF50`, `#FFC107`, `#FF9800`
*   **Role:** These colors are not core to the brand but are functional. They are used specifically in charts, infographics, and icons to **differentiate between data categories or feature modules**. Their use should be very restrained, limited to information display to avoid distracting from the primary brand colors.
